## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Error:** `Module not found` or dependency issues

**Solution:**
1. Make sure all dependencies are in `frontend/package.json`
2. Clear cache and redeploy: Settings â†’ General â†’ Clear Cache

### Environment Variables Not Working

**Error:** `undefined` values for env vars

**Solution:**
